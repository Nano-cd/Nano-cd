## üöÄ Selected Works

### üè≠ Industry Applications & Deployed Systems

*   **Fully Automated Medical Vision Inspection System (2024)**
    > Led the end-to-end development from algorithm selection to high-performance C++/ONNX deployment, including hardware integration. The system achieves **99%** detection accuracy and is stably running on multiple production lines.
    <details>
    <summary>üìú <b>Click to view System Architecture & Algorithm Details</b></summary>

    *   **System Architecture:** 
        1.  **Image Acquisition:** C++ SDK controls industrial cameras and syncs with LED light sources.
        2.  **Preprocessing:** OpenCV is used for image enhancement (e.g., contrast stretching, white balance).
        3.  **Model Inference:** PyTorch models are converted to ONNX and deployed in a C++ environment using ONNX Runtime for high performance.
        4.  **Post-processing & Output:** Morphological operations are applied to segmentation masks to reduce noise. Results are then formatted and delivered via a business logic interface.

    *   **Algorithm Details:**
        - **Model Selection:** A two-stage strategy was adopted: a lightweight **YOLOv8-n** for fast object localization, followed by **U-Net** for precise pixel-level segmentation within the ROI.
        - **Data Augmentation:** Custom augmentation strategies tailored for microscopic images, including random rotations, affine transforms, and simulated lighting variations.
        - **Loss Function:** A combination of **Dice Loss + Focal Loss** was used to effectively address class imbalance and small object segmentation challenges.
    </details>

*   **Signal Quality Optimization for Biochemical Analyzers (2025)**
    > Optimized core algorithms for clog detection, bubble detection, and two-point calibration. This data-driven approach reduced the equipment failure rate by **30%** and enabled early-warning for anomalies.
    <details>
    <summary>üìú <b>Click to view System Architecture & Algorithm Details</b></summary>

    *   **System Architecture:** 
        1.  **Data Ingestion:** Real-time/batch fetching of raw sensor data streams (pressure, optical signals) from the device database via SQL.
        2.  **Signal Processing Pipeline:** Built with Python (Pandas, NumPy) for filtering, noise reduction, and feature extraction.
        3.  **Multi-Algorithm Module:** Parallel execution of multiple detection algorithms.
        4.  **Decision & Alerting:** Fused outputs from all modules to generate diagnostic reports and trigger system alerts.

    *   **Algorithm Details:**
        - **Clog Detection:** Utilized **statistical features (mean, variance, kurtosis within a sliding window)** and template matching on time-series pressure data to detect anomalies.
        - **Bubble Detection:** Applied **high-pass filtering and peak detection** on optical signals to precisely identify transient dips caused by micro-bubbles.
        - **Two-Point Calibration:** Implemented **weighted non-linear fitting** to correct sensor drift across different concentrations, ensuring result accuracy and consistency.
    </details>

*   **Intelligent Consumable Management System (2025)**
    > An object detection-based system for automated identification and status monitoring of lab consumables, featuring a Gradio interface and a remote-callable API. Achieved **99%** detection rate.
    <details>
    <summary>üìú <b>Click to view System Architecture & Algorithm Details</b></summary>

    *   **System Architecture:** 
        1.  **Dynamic ROI Localization:** An initial "Workspace Analysis" algorithm automatically locates the consumable tray to eliminate background interference.
        2.  **Object Detection:** The detection model runs within the identified ROI to identify the type and count of consumables.
        3.  **Status Analysis:** The system determines the consumable status ("in-place", "missing", "in-use") based on changes in bounding box positions and counts.
        4.  **API Service:** A Gradio interface for quick demos and a C++ encapsulated RESTful API for integration with upstream systems.

    *   **Algorithm Details:**
        - **Workspace Analysis:** Leveraged **OpenCV's HSV color space conversion and contour finding** to robustly locate the workspace tray.
        - **Model Optimization:** Chose a lightweight **YOLOv5s** model and applied **INT8 quantization** to significantly boost inference speed on edge devices while maintaining accuracy.
        - **Robustness Design:** Trained the model on diverse data (various lighting, angles, occlusions) and used an **optimized NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) threshold** to enhance performance in complex scenes.
